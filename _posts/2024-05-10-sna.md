## Introduction
SNA is a powerful tool. It allows us to explore the underlying structure of an organization or network, identifying the formal and informal relationships that drive the formal processes and outcomes. This insight can enable better communication, facilitate change management, and inspire more efficient collaboration <d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>.

### Graphs
A network is represented by a graph $$G(V,E)$$. A graph $$G=(V,E)$$ is **ordered** pair of sets, where $$V$$ is denoted as set of vertices or nodes and $$E$$ is set of edges or links. The number of elements in $V$ is known as cardinality of $$V$$, $$n = |V|$$, and also for the edges, $$m = |E|$$. An edge $$e_{ij} = (v_i, v_j)$$ is pair of vertices (ordered pair for directed graph). Graph can also represented as matrix which known as adjacency matrix $$A^{n \times n}$$, and this matrix has nonzero element $$a_{ij}$$ when there is an edge $$e_{ij}$$.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sna/undirected-graph.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

In figure above describes the undirected graph which has five vertices or nodes and six edges and corresponds to its matrix form which has size of $$5 \times 5$$ matrix. Notice that the undirected graph is represented as **symmetric matrix**. We now use the term of *networks*, instead of graph, and so for vertices to *nodes*, and for edges to *links*. 

A network can be *undirected* or *directed*. A directed network is also called a **digraph**. In directed networks, links are called **directed links** and the order of the nodes in a link reflects the direction: the link $$(i,j)$$ goes from the source node $$i$$ to the target node $$j$$. A network can be *unweighted* or *weighted*. In a weighted network, links have associated weights: the weighted link $$(i,j, w)$$ between nodes $$i$$ and nodes $$j$$ has weight $$w$$. A network can be both directed and weighted, in which case it has *directed weighted links*.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sna/sampleofgraph.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Graphical representations of undirected, directed, and weighted networks. The circle represents the nodes. Pairs of adjacent nodes connected by a line (link) or arrow (directed link) which indicates the direction of the links. The thickness of a link represents its weight in weighted networks.
</div>

Here is the code for visualizing sample networks using `networkx` 

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/sna/networkx.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/sna/networkx.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

The maximum number of links in undirected network with $$N$$ nodes can be calculated

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{\text{max}} &= \binom{N}{2} \\
&= \frac{N!}{2!(N-2)!} \\
&= \frac{N(N-1)(N-2)!}{2!(N-2)!} \\
&= \frac{N(N-1)}{2}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$
